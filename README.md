# Writea üçµ Installer 
Install script for Writea (writea.prpl.wtf) for Linux servers

## What is Writea?
Writea is a fast and comfy open-source alternative for blogs. Write posts with Markdown, configure your blog with YAML, theme your page with CSS and much more! 

*Source, Writea's Github repo*

# Supported Operating systems
I have only tested the installer on Ubuntu 22 & Ubuntu 24 but it will most likely work on any (modern) Ubuntu or Debian version.

# How to get started
### Simply run the script command:
Using curl:
```curl -O https://installers.auri.lol/writea.sh && chmod +x writea.sh && ./writea.sh```

Using wget
```wget https://installers.auri.lol/writea.sh && chmod +x writea.sh && ./writea.sh```

**Do not run both, run whichever one you like better; I suggest using curl (the first one)**
